You need to do some manual setup to get Helpdesk working:

1.  Review settings in new config/initializers/helpdesk.rb and update where
    neccessary.

2.  Mount the engine into your application by editing your config/routes.rb

    mount Helpdesk::Engine, :at => "support"

3.  Install and run the migrations

    rake helpdesk:install:migrations

    rake db:migrate

4.  Add a helpdesk_user method to your applications application_controller.rb
    that exposes your current_user

    Example, for devise gem:
    def helpdesk_user
      current_user
    end

5.
